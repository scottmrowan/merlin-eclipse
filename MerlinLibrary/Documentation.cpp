*
* \subsection Linux
* The current method is to use cmake to build makefiles for Merlin
* 1: make a "build" folder outside the folder where Merlin was extracted.
* 2: run "cmake /path/to/merlin/folder"
* 3: run "ccmake /path/to/buildfolder"
* 4: Pick the options you wish to use.
* 5: run make -j < ncpu >
* 6: This will make the merlin library
*
* \subsection Windows
* Needs to be updated.
* \subsection OSX
* The optimal way to use Merlin on OSX is to get cmake to generate build files for Xcode.
* This of course requires that xcode is installed.
* By default cmake will generate unix makefiles.
* To generate Xcode files the appropriate generator must be specified when using cmake as:
*
* cmake -G Xcode
*
* One can then run:
*
* xcodebuild
*
* which will compile merlin.
* Other options exist such as "xcodebuild clean", which will clear out built files.
